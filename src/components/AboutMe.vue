      <p>
      Hello again! My name is Christopher Yip and I enjoy coding, cooking and playing board games
      (my current board games of choice are
      <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/13/catan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Catan</a>
      and

        Deception</a>).
      I first discovered web development in high school when I wrote my first HTML/CSS website on Notepad.
      </p>
      <p>
      Since my first website, I have graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Information and Communications
      Technology from Western Sydney University where I futher developed my skills and interest in software development.
      I currently work as a Software Developer at <a>Americold Logistics</a>, primarily working on
      updating/maintaining their in-house Warehouse Management System.
